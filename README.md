# One-Coin Realty

![Logo](Images/Logo.png)

At One Coin-Realty we strive to accelerate the process of buying and selling properties through the medium of smart contracts and tokenization. We streamline how investors/homeowners buy and sell high quality real estate assets, while increasing  the returns for sellers.  Our platform reduces the “friction” costs incurred by industry “middlemen”.

This Project has 4 step process:

1. Convert real estate documents into a digital asset class 

2. Mint the real estate asset into a registered NFT

3. Furnish the token with legal paperwork, sales details and technical descriptions

4. Connect the token to a crypto platform for selling  (smart contracts)
